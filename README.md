# ftDuino

This repository contains support files for the ftDuino fischertechnik
and Arduino compatible controller.

## Installation

You can easily add custom board support packages to the Arduino IDE
as described [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/add-boards-arduino-v164/overview).

Follow this instruction but use the [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harbaum/ftduino/master/package_ftduino_index.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harbaum/ftduino/master/package_ftduino_index.json) file instead. Afterwards the ftDuino board will show up in board manager from which it can easily be installed.

Once you've done that the ftDuino board shows up in the IDE and can be selected as the board to use.
